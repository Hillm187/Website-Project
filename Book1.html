        <p> Sacrifice one for the many. Since nobody believed it was true, Keya was determined to be that one. She dove into the lake, swimming all the way to the center, and waited. Suddenly a warm surge of water rushed up around her and hundreds of fish appeared swimming to the outer edges of the lake bringing the lake back to life. In the same breath she was pulled under. The force ripped a scream from her lungs, and she desperately tried to gasp one last time for air as she thrashed against the pressure surrounding her and pulled her down, down, down. The dark encompassed her, and her hands grasped for the last ray of light above her head until that disappeared and she felt the burn of her lungs yelling at her to breathe in, to let the water enter her lungs and sooth the burn from the inside. But she fought until she couldn't hold on any longer, and she closed her eyes as her body became weightless. She feels air forced back into her lungs, and her eyes fly open as she is greeted by a bright sky. Where was she? She turned her head slowly as she floated on the surface of the water, and her eyes slowly focused. That is when she saw a woman kneeling on the water's surface beside her. "Hello, my Blessed," she said, offering her a hand as she still floated in the water. "My name is Terriana." </p>
